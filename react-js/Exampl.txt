Easy to develop & maintain
We can develop application with out class system
Upgrading from One version to other version is very easy
Just Javascript is good for react
We typescript to develope react app.


# create react application
    you must have a node js
    development server (React) need node js
    but production we don't need node js

    npm ==> Node Package Manager
        install 
        uninstall
        run

    to install react application 
    npx => Node Package Executor
        runtime ===> download ==> install (react app) ==> remove unwanted lib/packages


    npx create-react-app name-of-app

    react ==> Main Lib (70%)
    react-dom ==> Work With Browser 
    react-scripts ==> run dev-server , build production code , testing application
     with cra-template

# directory structure
     packages.json ==> main project configuration
     src ==> folder contents
            all css files
            all js file
            all testing file
            all css fonts
            all background images file need for css

    public ==> folder contents
            index.html 
            favicon
            all images files


index.js ==> main entry file of our project
App.js ==> Component of react
    Component/Components :: are basic building  blocks 

    Component
        import (optional) :: use a code.function of other file
        logic (mandatory) :: actual code
        export (mandatory) :: make availability for other file

        Component Name  1st letter must be capital
        Every Component has return type

    Component 
        We write a html like code => JSX :: Javascript XML

        JSX ==> must always has/have one parent
        <></> ==> JSX fragment

        <div class="">  ==> <div className="">
        <label for="">  ==> <label htmlFor="">
        <input> <br>  ==> <input /> <br/>
        <section style="color:red"> ==> <section style={{ color:"red" }}>
        <section style="background-color:red;color:green"> ==> <section style={{ backgroundColor:"red", color:'green' }}>
