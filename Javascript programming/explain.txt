How to run javascript Code ?
    # In HTML without javascript file   ==>  script
    # Call a  javascript file in HTML  ==> script src="<path_of_js_file>"

If we want to change data in html from javascript.
    # DOM ==> Document Object Model
    # DOM Tree ==> DOM tree is logical representation of code in tree format
    # DOM parent element is always a "<html>"

    # then you apply logic on that element
