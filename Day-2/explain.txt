        # Node JS 
            => is a runtime environment for Javascript (support to run a javascript code without browser)
            => create a server from node JS
            not server , not language , not lib , not a Framework

        # Express JS :: it's Framework of node js (minimal & flexible ) (MVC)
            # routing
